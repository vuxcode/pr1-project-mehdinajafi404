REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

- **The Description:**

This is a game with minimal design, quick movement, and a maze that turns your mistakes into art. Guide the yellow player toward the white exit, watch the walls light up when you hit them, and reset for a brand new layout every time. A small game built for fun and maybe to spark a bit of creativity in you too. 

- **My Reflection:**

My original idea was to create a simple maze game with a single path and use all the skills I’ve learned in the programming course. But I also had this idea in the back of my mind to make the game really hard and fun, like Dark Souls games. The problem was that I didn’t have all the skills necessary to make exactly what I imagined, and I’m still not fully satisfied with how I want the game to look, but I’m happy with it for now. The hardest part for me was creating the algorithm, because I had to learn some new concepts. Still, it was fun because it pushed me to learn more. Overall, the project was really enjoyable because we had the freedom to do whatever we wanted.

- **What could be improved?**

  There are a lot of things I want to improve if I had the skills and time to do so. Here are some of them:

  - _The main thing I want to improve or change is the difficulty. I don’t want the maze to take longer to solve, but I want it to be truly challenging. One of my ideas is to keep the maze invisible as it is, and each time the player hits a wall, they get punished with a random pop-up question. If they answer correctly, they can continue guessing the path. Each time they hit a wall and get closer to the goal, the questions become harder—but if they answer one wrong, they go back to the start._
  - _Make the canvas bigger so it covers the whole page._
  - _Add a small timer on the screen for the player to track how fast they can solve the maze._
  - _Make the player circle-shaped (because the player represents the sun or the light inside the maze)._
  - _Etc…_


- **The budget:**

I didn’t think too much about the budget, as long as I was consistently working on my project while also having fun learning new concepts. It took me more time than I had documented because I had to watch others and learn, but the coding itself didn’t take that long. The hardest part was understanding why and how each thing works.

# User Guide

> Write a clear user guide for how someone should use your program.

Use the arrow keys or WASD (with Caps Lock off) to move the player. The goal is to reach the white square. When you hit a wall, the wall gets a random color. If you want to reset, just hit the "Reset" button and the game will start over with a different maze each time.
